# BoardGames

## Overview
BoardGames is a collection of classic games implemented with both human and computer-controlled players. The project currently includes Treblecross and plans for future development of Reversi.

## Features

### Player Types
- **Human Player**: Users can input moves, which are validated by the game system.
- **Computer Player**: AI selects moves randomly from the available valid options.

### Game Development
- **Treblecross**: Fully implemented with complete gameplay mechanics.
- **Reversi**: Not yet implemented, but planned for future development.

### Replayability
- Supports saving and restoring game states, allowing players to resume their gameplay at any time.

### Move Management
- Players can undo and redo their moves before confirming them.
- After loading a saved game, undo and redo are initially disabled. However, after making the first move, human players regain the ability to undo and redo.

### Player Assistance
- A built-in help system guides new players through the game rules.
- Example scenarios demonstrate winning strategies.

### Save and Load System
- Players can save their progress and reload their game later.
- When a saved file is loaded, the system automatically switches turns. For example, if Player A saves the game, upon loading it, the turn will switch to Player B.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementation of Reversi.
- Improved AI for Computer Players.
- More flexible save/load functionalities with enhanced undo/redo features.

## How to Play
1. Start the game and choose between a human or computer opponent.
2. Make moves according to the game rules.
3. Use the undo/redo feature before confirming a move.
4. Save your game to continue later.
5. Load a saved game and resume from the last saved state.
